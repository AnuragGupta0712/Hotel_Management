The Hotel and Rating Service project is a Spring Boot-based system managing hotels and their ratings. It includes RESTful APIs for hotel operations, integration with a rating service for real-time updates, and custom exception handling for errors like missing hotels or ratings. It ensures seamless interaction between services for accurate data.
